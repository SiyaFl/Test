</h1>
    <P>
        Makhaya Ntini OIS (born 6 July 1977) is a South African former professional cricketer, <br>
        who played all forms of the game. He was the first ethnically black player to play for the <br>
        South African national cricket team and works on TV as a commentator.<br>
        He reached second place in the ICC Test match bowling ratings and was the third South <br>
        African cricketer to take 300 Test cricket wickets, after Shaun Pollock and Allan Donald. <br>
        In December 2017, his son Thando Ntini was named in South Africa’s squad for the 2018 Under-19 <br>
        Cricket World Cup.

    <h2>Early recognition</h2>
    Ntini was born in Mdingi, a small village in Cape Province, which is near King William's Town <br>
    (currently in Eastern Cape Province).[2] He was discovered by a Border Cricket Board development <br>
    officer,who was setting up a mini-cricket programme. Although Ntini was both too old and too big to<br>
    participate in the programme the officer, Raymond Booi, noticed the bared-footed cowherd's enthusiasm<br>
    and talent for bowling. He lent the 15-year-old Ntini a pair of plimsolls and arranged for him to<br>
    participate in a net session in King William's Town. Ntini impressed Booi, who contacted Greg Hayes,<br>
    the head of the development programme. The pair placed Ntini in a junior cricket festival in <br>
    Queenstown and Hayes purchased Ntini his first pair of boots for the festival, but later had to<br>
    give the young bowler instructions not to wear them indoor or when herding cattle.[3]
    <br>
    Two years later, he was selected to tour England with the South Africa Under-19 squad and <br>
    played all five of the youth internationals. England dominated both One Day Internationals<br>
    (ODIs) during the tour, with the South Africans only managing to take one wicket across the <br>
    two matches, which fell to Pierre Joubert.[4] In the Test series, which England won 2–0,<br>
    Ntini claimed nine wickets, the second-most by a South African bowler.[5] His bowling was <br>
    expensive, coming at a rate of 4.53 runs per over: more than any other South African with the<br>
    exception of Mark Boucher, who is best known as a wicket-keeper.[5][6]
